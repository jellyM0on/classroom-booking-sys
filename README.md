# ðŸ“š IskolaRoom: Classroom Booking Management System

## Overview

**IskolaRoom** is a full-stack web application designed for managing room reservations across multiple facilities and departments in an educational institution. It incorporates role-based access control, enabling different levels of access for administrators and regular users (students or faculty), and streamlining the process of room booking, approval, and scheduling.

## Specifications

### âœ… Functional Requirements

1. **User Management**
   - Admins can create, view, and manage user accounts.
   - Users (students or faculty) are invited by admins and set their passwords via email verification.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Two roles: Admin and User.
   - Admins have full access to manage facilities, rooms, departments, and booking approvals.
   - Users can create and manage their own bookings only.

3. **Facility and Room Management**
   - Admins can perform CRUD operations on facilities (buildings).
   - Facilities can have multiple rooms with attributes like capacity and equipment.

4. **Department Management**
   - Admins define academic departments; each user belongs to one.
   - Bookings can be filtered or reported by department.

5. **Booking Workflow**
   - `Draft`: Booking in progress, not yet submitted.
   - `Pending`: Submitted for admin approval.
   - `Approved`: Confirmed booking.
   - `Rejected`: Declined by the admin.
   - `Cancelled`: Users can cancel pending/approved bookings before the event date.

6. **Availability Checking**
   - Server-side logic prevents overlapping active bookings for the same room and time slot.

7. **Notifications**
   - Email alerts for account setup, password reset, and booking status updates.

## Business Rules

1. **User Invitation**
   - Only admins can register new users; self-registration is not allowed.

2. **Role Enforcement**
   - Only admins can manage facilities, departments, and booking approvals.
   - Users are restricted to viewing and managing their own bookings.

3. **Booking Status Transitions**
   - Bookings begin as `Draft`.
   - Submitted drafts become `Pending`.
   - Admins can approve or reject.
   - Users may cancel `Pending` or `Approved` bookings (before the event date).

4. **Room Availability**
   - No overlapping `Approved` bookings allowed for the same room and timeslot.

5. **Deletion Rules**
   - Only `Draft` bookings may be deleted by users.
   - Other statuses cannot be deleted.

6. **Time Constraints**
   - Bookings must be scheduled within operational hours (e.g., 08:00â€“20:00).
